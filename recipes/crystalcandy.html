    <p><em>Crystal Blue Rock Candy</em> is created in some of the <strong>finest</strong> mobile labs in the state of New Mexico, trying to create this masterpiece in a home kitchen could lead to more than just a knock from police...</p>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup water, (4 fl oz)</li>
        <li>8.25 oz light corn syrup, (3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>14 oz granulated sugar, (2 cups)</li>
        <li>2 tsp clear flavoring extract</li>
        <li>Blue gel food coloring – royal blue</li>
        <li>Candy thermometer</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Recipe to Prepare:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with foil and spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray, or use non-stick foil.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, corn syrup, and granulated sugar. Place the pan over medium-high heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Once it comes to a simmer, brush down the sides with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming. Insert a candy thermometer.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook the candy without stirring until it reads 290 degrees Fahrenheit (143 C) on the thermometer. Watch the temperature carefully–a lower temperature might produce sticky candy, while a higher temperature runs the risk of producing green candy!</li>
        <li>Once at 290, take the pan off the heat and let it sit for a few moments, until rapid bubbles stop breaking on the surface. Add the flavoring and a drop or two of food coloring, and stir everything together.</li>
        <li>Pour the candy onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it into a thin layer. Let it set completely at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Once set, break it into small pieces. For the complete Breaking Bad experience, place the pieces in a large zip-top bag and smash them with a rolling pin until they are crushed, and place in small baggies to serve.</li>
        <li>Store the candy in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
